# What is software testing ?
 Testing is a part of software development process , it is a activity to detect and identify the defects in the software. the objective of the testing is to release quality product to the client   
>Company ---> IT company ---> Developing -->> Testing ---> Deliver ---> X-bank Company 

# what is Software Quality?
1. Bug-Free
2. Delivered on time
3. Within budget 
4. Meets requirements /expectations
5. Maintainable  

# What is Project and product ?
- If software application is developed for specific customer requirement  is called project.
- If software application is developed for multiple customer based on market requirement  is called product.

# why we need testing?
 Ultimate goals is deliver quality application to the customer/Client. 

# Error , Bug & Failure

- Incorrect human actions is called **Error** . *happens by developers*
- Deviation  from expected behaviour is called **Bug**  *found by QA's*
- Deviation found by the end user while working with the application is called **Failure**  *happens in Productions* 

# why the software has bugs ?
- Miscommunication or no communication
- Software complexity
- Programming error
- Changing requirements
- Lacks of skilled tester

# SDLC?
- software development life cycle - step by step process used by software industry to design , develop and test software and deliver it to the clients.

 3(P) pillar of a company 
 - People
 - Process
 - Product

 # SDLC
 > Requirement Analysis--> Design --> Development --> Testing ---> Maintenance

 # Waterfall Model (Linear Model)
 - SRS Document- Software Requirement Specification
 - Requirement Analysis ---> System Design ---> Development ---> Testing ---> Deployment ---> Maintenance
 - (Every pahase depend on the previous phase )
 
**Advantages**
  1. Quality products will be good
  2. Since Requirement changes is not allowed, there are low chances of bugs 
  3. Intial Investement is less , since QA are hired at later stages
  4. Preferred For small projects where requirement are freezed

**Disadvantages**
 1. Requirements Changes are not allowed
 2. If there is defect in the requirement that will continue in the later phases
 3. Total Investment is more, because of time taking for rework on defects is time consuming which leads to high investement 
 4. Testing will only start after coding 


 # Spiral Model (Iterable model )
this model is suitable for product based software,in this type of model after every iteration new software is released as per the customer requirement.

1. spiral model is iterative model
2. spiral model overcome drawbacks of waterfall model
3. we follow spiral model whenever there is dependency on the modules
4. in every cycle new software will be realeased to customer
5. software will be released in multiple versions. so it is called version control model

**Advantages**
1. Testing is done in every cycle, before going to the next cycle 
2. Customer will get to use the softwre for every module
3. requirement changes are allowed after every cycle before going to the next cycle

**Disadvantages**
1. Requirement changes are not allowed in between the cycle 
2. Every cycle of spiral model looks like waterfall model 
3. There is no testing in requirement and design phase 

# Prototype
- blue print of the software
- initial requirement from the customer --> prototype --> Customer --> Designing , Coding , Testing
- Module is the simple component of the software 

# V- Model / VV model 
- Verifications and Validation model 
- In every phase we do testing requirement phase, design phase , development phase etc in every phase we testing
- BRS/CRS/URS -----------------------> User Acceptance Testing 
- SRS (Software requirment specification)---------------------System Testing 
- HLD/LLD(low level design )-----------------------------> Intergration Testing 
- Coding ------------------------> Unit Testing 

> Static Testing - testing a project related document is called Statis testing in the form of **Review, walthrough and Inspection**.

> Dynamic Testing - Testing the actual Software 

# what is verification and validation

- Verification checks whether we are building the right product
- focus on documentation , any one can verify  

- Validation  checks whether we are building the product right 
- Take place after verification are completed 

**Advantages**
- Testing is involved in each phase 
- 

**Disadvantages**
- documentaion is more
- investment is very high
